# Commit and Push Your First Change
Now that all the changes we make in this directory are being tracked, we're ready to save the changes made to the repository up until this point. Because this is our first save, all of the contents in the repository will be treated as new changes. To stage all of the changes to be saved, we use the following command.
```shell
$ git init
```
