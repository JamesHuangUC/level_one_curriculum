# Initializing Git
Over the next three days, we're going to be writing a lot of code. You're going to want to save all of your hard work along the way. Sometimes, you'll want to rewind and go back to an older version of your code, maybe because you didn't like the direction you took it in.

To help with these version control and saving tasks, we use a program called Git, which is already installed in Cloud9. To start tracking the changes we make to our code, we must initialize the repository we're currently working in, telling it to use git.

To do this, first, we make sure we're in the correct directory. In our case, we want to be in the workspace directory. Using the correct terminal command, ensure that you are all in the correct directory.

>Give your students a moment to check their current working directory with pwd.

Now that we're sure we're where we want to be, we initialize the repo to use git by using the following command
```shell
$ git init
```

This command stands for git initialize.

>Give you students a minute to use the git init command to initialize their repository.
