# Peer Interviews Activity

### Required Materials
  *  Paper
  * Pens or Pencils
  * Pre-Activity Setup
  * The students will split up into pairs.  Each student will need a piece of paper and pen/pencil to take notes.

### Goals
  Christina's story is her own but about our students?  They each have their own version of Christina's story and that's what we want them to realize and tell.  We want each student to find their personal narrative that makes our time management tool relevant to them.

### Instructions
  * **Mock Interview** - Students will break off into pairs and interview each other about how time management effects their life. We each student to really relive a specific moment of time management struggle.
  * **Time Limit** - Each student has 3 minutes to conduct the interview of their partner.
  * **Take Notes** - Remind each student to stay engaged with their interviewee while taking thorough notes.  These notes will be needed for another activity.
  * **Interview Questions** - To help each student we will provide them with a list of interview questions.
    * How do you keep track of the things you need to do?
    * Where were you the last time you wrote down your to-dos?
    * Did you tell anyone else what you needed to do?
    * When was the last time you forgot to get something done and what were the consequences (what opportunity did you miss, what penalty occurred)
    * Did you tell anyone about missing your action or its consequences?
    * How did you feel when you realized you forgot to get something done?
    *  When was the last time you procrastinated on something (left it to the last minute and barely got it done, probably not your best effort)?
    * Did you start looking for ways to help you keep track of your to-dos better?
