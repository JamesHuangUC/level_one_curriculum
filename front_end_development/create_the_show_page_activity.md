# Create the Show Page Activity
Now that we've added and tagged all of our content in our index.html files, it's time to create a show page for the first todo in our list. The purpose of the show page is to display the information of a single todo in detail, and allow the user to perform some additional functionality that they are not able to to perform directly from the todo list on our index page.
