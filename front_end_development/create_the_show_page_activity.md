# Create the Show Page Activity
Now that we've added and tagged all of our content in our index.html files, it's time to create a show page for the first todo in our list. The purpose of the show page is to display the information of a single todo in detail, and allow the user to perform some additional functionality that they are not able to to perform directly from the todo list on our index page.

Open your show.html file in Cloud9, and add the HTML document structure tags and a title for your show page. Then, in the body section of your HTML document, add the content for the description of the todo, the pomodoro estimate, a link to edit the todo, a link to delete the todo, and a link to go back to the index page. Make sure to tag all of your content semantically.

>Give your students time to complete this portion of the activity. They are going to have many questions, and will need help. Tell them to reference their index.html file when they are stuck or not sure how to proceed. You can use the HTML code below as a guide for what their code should look like when they are done.

*show.html*
```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Todo List Application</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Make the curriculum 4 Pomodoros</h2>
    <a href="#">Edit</a>
    <a href="#">Delete</a>
    <a href="#">Go back...</a>
  </body>
</html>
```
After you've fleshed our your show.html file, run your server in Cloud9 and view your show page live.
