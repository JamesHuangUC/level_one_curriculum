# HTML Tags and Basic Document Structure

## Introduction to HTML Tags
An HTML element usually consists of a beginning tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between. HTML tags usually consist of a less than symbol, followed by the tag name, followed by a greater than symbol.

HTML tags follow a methodology called semantic tagging. This means that the tags used to wrap the content describe the kind of content that is being wrapped.

There are many predefined HTML tags. You should always strive to use the HTML tags that best describe the content they're wrapping.

Sometimes, there is no good predefined HTML tag for the type of content you have. In these cases, you can use one of HTML's more generic tags to mark the content.

HTML should be used strictly for tagging the content on your web page, and never for styling how the content looks in the browser. We use CSS for that!

## Set Up Basic Document Structure
When starting a new HTML document, there are a set of HTML tags we need to start off with by default. These tags make up the basic HTML document structure.

>Share the HTML document structure tags below with your students and have them cut and paste the tags into their index.html documents above their content.

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
