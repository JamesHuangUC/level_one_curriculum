# CSS Selectors
A CSS selector is the part of the CSS rule that selects the content you want to style. There are many CSS selectors, but for today, we are going to focus on the following:

## Selectors
  * Element Type Selector
  * Class Selector
  * ID Selector
  * Pseudo Class Selector

#### Element Type Selector
This selector can also be referred to simply as a â€œtype selector." Type selectors must match an HTML element of the same name. For example, a selector of `ul` would match the HTML `<ul>` element. A `li` selector would match all the `<li>` elements in an HTML document.
