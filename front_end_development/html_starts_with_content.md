#HTML Starts With Content
The main purpose of HTML is to manage the content we want to display on the web. So we'll start by entering our content into our HTML file. Write out the title of this page. Write out your list of actual to-dos that you and your partner have to complete within the next week. Remember you'll also need a link on this page to add a new to-do to the list. All we're going to do is type the words that reflect what we want to appear on the page.

>Give the students 2-3 minutes to complete this. Cut and paste the code below into your HTML file in Cloud9. Run the server and show the students what it looks like. Ask them if theirs looks similar.
