# The Box Model
Every HTML element on the page can be though of as a box. Regardless of what the elements look like on the page, their footprint is that of a box. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about the design and layout of your content.

There are four elements that make up the box that is every HTML element: content, padding, border and margin.

## Breaking Down The Box Model
* **Content** - The content you have specified insinde the element in your HTML file
* **Padding** - An area of space directly around the content. The padding is transparent. It is used to create space between the content and the border.
* **Border**  - A visible or invisible border that goes around the content and padding of the element.
* **Margin**  - An area of space directly around the border. The margin is transparent. It is used to create space between the HTML element it wraps around and other HTML elements on the page.
