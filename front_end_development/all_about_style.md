# All About Style
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheets language that is used to describe the presentation of an HTML document. What this means is if HTML is strictly used to describe the content on your web page, CSS is used strictly to describe how that content looks and is laid out.

CSS can be applied to HTML in a few different ways. We'll be writing our CSS in the separate CSS files your created on day one of the workshop.

## Introduction to CSS Rules
You write CSS by defining a series of what are called rules. Here is an example of a CSS rule that makes `<h1>` HTML elements orange.

Each CSS rule has two major components: a selector that links the CSS rule to a specific part of the HTML document, and a set of one or more declarations.

Each declaration contains a property and a value. The property refers to the characteristic of the selector you want to change and the value refers to how you want to change the property. Your students can find an extensive list of CSS properties at [W3 Schools CSS Selector Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp "W3 Schools CSS Selector Reference").
