# Welcome to Ruby on Rails

## Introduction

Over the next two days, you’ll turn your todo list static pages into a Ruby on Rails web application. The purpose of this weekend is to get a high-level understanding of Ruby on Rails programming and web development, by using what are called scaffold generators, which can create large parts of your application automatically. With this exposure and familiarity, you can go into Level Two of the CodeNow program, which will take you through the concepts of front and back-end development in much greater detail.

Our todo list application will consist of lists and their associated todos. The functionality will be basic, and many of the steps will seem like magic, but you’ll be able to identify the different parts and processes of a Rails application. You'll leave the workshop with a plan to go beyond the superficial, scaffold-driven process to achieve a much deeper understanding of how to code web applications. At the end of this weekend, your application will be live on the web, and you'll be able to share the URL so everyone can see what you have built!

Let's get started by setting up the GitHub repository that will house your Rails Application, and creating the new Cloud9 workspace where you'll write all of your code!
