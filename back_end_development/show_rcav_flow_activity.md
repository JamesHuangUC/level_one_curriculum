# Show **RCAV** Flow Activity
Now that we've gone through the **RCAV** flow for the todo index page, it's time for you to try to go through the flow yourself. This time, for the show page. After you have complete the flow, add your show.html and show.css code from your todo_app_front_end to your Rails application.

We want the user to type /todo/show in the URL bar and see your show page.

Remember - **Route, Controller, Action, and View**!

If you need help along the way, you can look at my example code from these two commits.

1. [Complete RCAV flow for Todo Show](https://github.com/CodeNowOrg/todo_app_back_end/tree/8f2ab6191d7b571b504a3cb0b5ced9e513420a12 "Complete RCAV flow for Todo Show")
2. [Add Show HTML and CSS From Front End Mockup to Application](https://github.com/CodeNowOrg/todo_app_back_end/tree/1068a19453f7d35fdc915bcd26bb3bb380f13dd6 "Add Show HTML and CSS From Front End Mockup to Application")
