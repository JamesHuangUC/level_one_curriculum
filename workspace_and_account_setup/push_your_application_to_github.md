# Push Your Application to GitHub

Just like we did during weekend one, we will be pushing our code to another GitHub repository. This way, as you make changes and add to your code, you'll be able to save your progress and not be at risk of losing your work.

Use the following commands to make your first commit for this project.

```shell
git add -A
```

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

```shell
git push
```

Now check your repository on GitHub to see if the changes were successfully pushed.
